# Graph-Based Recommendation
_A gentle introduction to recommender systems working with and on graphs._

### Abstract

Most of today’s data is structured as nodes connected through edges forming graphs, from molecules and drugs to traffic flows and social networks. The same applies to data stored on popular online platforms (e.g., Amazon, Netflix, X, Booking.com) which host vast and heterogenous catalogues of products or services enjoyed daily by different customer segments. 

In this respect, recommender systems are complex algorithms designed to match users preferences and tastes to products and services, easing our navigation experience while improving the revenues of the companies behind those online platforms. 

However, traditional recommendation approaches fail to perceive the user-item recommendation data as graph structures, disregarding a large amount of meaningful properties and characteristics that could be exploited to improve the recommendation quality. 

Conversely, graph-based recommender systems leverage the user-item graph topology at multiple distance hops to derive finer-grained preference patters of users interacting with items. 

The scope of this lecture is to provide the useful background notions regarding traditional recommendation, and the rationales behind the more improved and recent approaches from graph-based recommendation. Then, it presents pioneer solutions in graph-based recommendation leveraging, among others, random-walk techniques and graph neural networks.
